                <p class="para">We have had an insight into Artificial Intelligence. Well, one of its subfields is machine learning and this introduction will help you get a fair idea of what a machine learning online course holds. To begin with, one must understand what machine learning is. Basically, it is a concept wherein a machine attempts to understand the structure of a data and fits that into models that people can understand and utilize. While traditional forms of computing were all about solving problems using set instructions and data, machine learning is all about computers utilizing data, training on it and using statistical data to output values. Thus, in this way, the process of decision-making is automated for computers based on sample input data. Now that we know what Machine Learning is all about, it’s time to delve in a little deeper.</p>
